## Running the Server

To run the server, execute the following command in the project directory:


This will start the server using Nodemon, which monitors for any changes in your TypeScript files and automatically restarts the server.

## Usage

Once the server is running, it will be accessible via the specified port. You can then proceed to integrate it with your Angular frontend or test the API endpoints using tools like Postman.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to check the `package.json` file for available scripts and commands.

- Refer to Sequelize documentation for more information on defining models and interacting with the database.
